Choose one of many headers, than order sections in a manner that you like or suits to your product, chooose your background, add images and you are ready to go. 

Template is prepared to use plain JavaScript, ES6, Jquery or Typescript. Furthermore it is based on Bootstrap 4 and profits from SASS. There is DisplayDetect added for quick loading of the website and all its content. What is more project is also enhanced by smooth scroll which improves user experience. Whole project is displayed in browser using Devserver which enables to see all the changes live. When the project is finished boilerplate creates a final build in folder public_html with your project alone. From the tool it self you can add your project to FTP.
